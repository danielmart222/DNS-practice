<h1> DNS Practice Lab </h1>
In this tutorial, I will use Client-1 and DC-1 to do a few exercises to better understand DNS. I will inspect DNS A-Records on the server (hostname to IP address mappings), create some of our own A-Records on the server, and observe them from the client. I will also delete records from the server and observe the client DNS cache to gain understanding. Then, I will create a CNAME Record (mapping one name to another name).
